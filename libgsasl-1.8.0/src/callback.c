/**
 * gsasl_callback_set:
 * @ctx: handle received from gsasl_init().
 * @cb: pointer to function implemented by application.
 *
 * Store the pointer to the application provided callback in the
 * library handle.  The callback will be used, via gsasl_callback(),
 * by mechanisms to discover various parameters (such as username and
 * passwords).  The callback function will be called with a
 * Gsasl_property value indicating the requested behaviour.  For
 * example, for %GSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN, the function is expected to
 * invoke gsasl_property_set(@CTX, %GSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN, "token")
 * where "token" is the anonymous token the application wishes the
 * SASL mechanism to use.  See the manual for the meaning of all
 * parameters.
 *
 * Since: 0.2.0

 *
 * Invoke the application callback.  The @prop value indicate what the
