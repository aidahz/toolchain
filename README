Vitesse toolchain.

Major 3rd party tools/softwares are installed in this directory.  

Installation:
run ./build.sh

To build postgres, one need to set env variable TOOLCHAIN_DIR, I found
that it is easiest to just put that in your .bashrc file,

TOOLCHAIN_DIR=/path/to/toolchain

We do not expect software in toolchain dir change often, so sharing 
this env variable for many git tree is most likely OK. 

==========================================================
NOTE on gtest make --
For some reason, gtest by default does not build libgtest.a, so has to
do the following
    cd gtest_dir
    cmake .
    make
    mv libg* ../installed/lib
Too bad, don't think it worth the time to automate.
