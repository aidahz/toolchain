Vitesse toolchain.

Major 3rd party tools/softwares are installed in this directory.  

Installation:
run ./build.sh

To build postgres, one need to set env variable TOOLCHAIN_DIR, I found
that it is easiest to just put that in your .bashrc file,

TOOLCHAIN_DIR=/path/to/toolchain

We do not expect software in toolchain dir change often, so sharing 
this env variable for many git tree is most likely OK. 

==========================================================
NOTE on gtest make --
For some reason, gtest by default does not build libgtest.a, so has to
do the following
    cd gtest_dir
    cmake .
    make
    mv libg* ../installed/lib
Too bad, don't think it worth the time to automate.

gflags
    cd gflags
    mkdir build
    cd build; cmake ..; make


================== On Thrift and Parquet ==================
One must install dependecies,
On Centos
    boost, boost-devel, and boost-static,
    libtool, libevent-devel, openssl-devel, zlib-devel

Note that we get thrift from git, latest 0.9.2 release seems to
have trouble building c++ library.

Once build, make install, and must set THRIFT_HOME to toolchain/installed, 
then one can build parquet-cpp.

Beats me, even thinking about automate these stuff.  Later ...
