@deftypefn Prototype int (*Gsasl_server_callback_validate) (Gsasl_session_ctx * @var{ctx}, char * @var{authorization_id}, char * @var{authentication_id}, char * @var{password})

@var{ctx}:  libgsasl handle.

@var{authorization_id}:  input array with authorization identity.

@var{authentication_id}:  input array with authentication identity.

@var{password}:  input array with password.

Type of callback function the application implements.  It should
return GSASL_OK if and only if the validation of the provided
credential was succesful.  GSASL_AUTHENTICATION_ERROR is a good
failure if authentication failed, but any available return code may be
used.
