Abstract

   The Simple Authentication and Security Layer [SASL] is a method for
   adding authentication support to connection-based protocols.  This
   document describes the method for using the Generic Security Service
   Application Program Interface [GSSAPI] KERBEROS V5 and SPNEGO in the
   Simple Authentication and Security Layer [SASL].

   This document replaces section 7.2 of RFC 2222 [SASL], the definition
   of the "GSSAPI" SASL mechanism.

2.  Introduction and Overview

   This specification documents currently deployed Kerberos V5 and
   SPNEGO GSSAPI mechanisms used within SASL.  The basic description is
   common between the two and is described in Section 3.  The described
   authentication sequence has known limitations that will be addressed
   by a separate document, in particular lack of channel bindings and
   the number of round trips required to complete authentication
   exchange.

   The SASL mechanism name for the Kerberos V5 GSSAPI mechanism
   [KRB5GSS] is "GSSAPI" and the SASL mechanism for the SPNEGO GSSAPI
   mechanism [SPNEGO] is "GSS-SPNEGO".

   The IESG is considered to be the owner of all SASL mechanisms which
   conform to this document.  This does NOT necessarily imply that the
   IESG is considered to be the owner of the underlying GSSAPI
   mechanism.

3.  Specification common to both Kerberos V5 and SPNEGO GSSAPI
    mechanisms

   The implementation MAY set any GSSAPI flags or arguments not
   mentioned in this specification as is necessary for the
   implementation to enforce its security policy.

3.1  Client side of authentication protocol exchange

   The client calls GSS_Init_sec_context, passing in
   input_context_handle of 0 (initially), mech_type of the GSSAPI
   mechanism for which this SASL mechanism is registered, chan_binding
   of NULL, and targ_name equal to output_name from GSS_Import_Name
   called with input_name_type of GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE and
   input_name_string of "service@hostname" where "service" is the
   service name specified in the protocol's profile, and "hostname" is
   the fully qualified host name of the server.  If the client will be
   requesting a security layer, it MUST also supply to the
   GSS_Init_sec_context a mutual_req_flag of TRUE, a sequence_req_flag
   of TRUE, and an integ_req_flag of TRUE.  If the client will be
   requesting a security layer providing confidentiality protection, it
   MUST also supply to the GSS_Init_sec_context a conf_req_flag of TRUE.
   The client then responds with the resulting output_token.  If
   GSS_Init_sec_context returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, then the client
   should expect the server to issue a token in a subsequent challenge.
   The client must pass the token to another call to
   GSS_Init_sec_context, repeating the actions in this paragraph.

   When GSS_Init_sec_context returns GSS_S_COMPLETE, the client examines
   the context to ensure that it provides a level of protection
   permitted by the client's security policy.  If the context is
   acceptable, the client takes the following actions: If the last call
   to GSS_Init_sec_context returned an output_token, then the client
   responds with the output_token, otherwise the client responds with no
   data.  The client should then expect the server to issue a token in a
   subsequent challenge.  The client passes this token to GSS_Unwrap and
   interprets the first octet of resulting cleartext as a bit-mask
   specifying the security layers supported by the server and the second
   through fourth octets as the network byte order maximum size
   output_message to send to the server (if the resulting cleartext is
   not 4 octets long, the client fails the negotiation).  The client
   verifies that the server maximum buffer is 0 if the server doesn't
   advertise support for any security layer.  The client then constructs
   data, with the first octet containing the bit-mask specifying the
   selected security layer, the second through fourth octets containing
   in network byte order the maximum size output_message the client is
   able to receive, and the remaining octets containing the UTF-8 [UTF8]
   encoded authorization identity.  (Implementation note: the

   authorization identity is not terminated with the NUL (%x00)
   character).  The client passes the data to GSS_Wrap with conf_flag
   set to FALSE, and responds with the generated output_message.  The
   client can then consider the server authenticated.

3.2  Server side of authentication protocol exchange

   The server passes the initial client response to
   GSS_Accept_sec_context as input_token, setting input_context_handle
   to 0 (initially), mech_type of the GSSAPI mechanism for which this
   SASL mechanism is registered, chan_binding of NULL, and
   acceptor_cred_handle equal to output_cred_handle from
   GSS_Acquire_cred called with desired_name equal to output_name from
   GSS_Import_name with input_name_type of GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE
   and input_name_string of "service@hostname" where "service" is the
   service name specified in the protocol's profile, and "hostname" is
   the fully qualified host name of the server.  If
   GSS_Accept_sec_context returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, the server
   returns the generated output_token to the client in challenge and
   passes the resulting response to another call to
   GSS_Accept_sec_context, repeating the actions in this paragraph.

   When GSS_Accept_sec_context returns GSS_S_COMPLETE, the server
   examines the context to ensure that it provides a level of protection
   permitted by the server's security policy.  If the context is
   acceptable, the server takes the following actions: If the last call
   to GSS_Accept_sec_context returned an output_token, the server
   returns it to the client in a challenge and expects a reply from the
   client with no data.  Whether or not an output_token was returned
   (and after receipt of any response from the client to such an
   output_token), the server then constructs 4 octets of data, with the
   first octet containing a bit-mask specifying the security layers
   supported by the server and the second through fourth octets
   containing in network byte order the maximum size output_token the
   server is able to receive (which MUST be 0 if the server doesn't
   support any security layer).  The server must then pass the plaintext
   to GSS_Wrap with conf_flag set to FALSE and issue the generated
   output_message to the client in a challenge.  The server must then
   pass the resulting response to GSS_Unwrap and interpret the first
   octet of resulting cleartext as the bit-mask for the selected
   security layer, the second through fourth octets as the network byte
   order maximum size output_message to send to the client, and the
   remaining octets as the authorization identity.  The server verifies
   that the client has selected a security layer that was offered, and
   that the client maximum buffer is 0 if no security layer was chosen.
   The server must verify that the src_name is authorized to act as the
   authorization identity.  After these verifications, the
   authentication process is complete.

3.3  Security layer

   The security layers and their corresponding bit-masks are as follows:

         1 No security layer
         2 Integrity protection.
           Sender calls GSS_Wrap with conf_flag set to FALSE
         4 Confidentiality protection.
           Sender calls GSS_Wrap with conf_flag set to TRUE

   Other bit-masks may be defined in the future; bits which are not
   understood must be negotiated off.

   Note that SASL negotiates the maximum size of the output_message to
   send.  Implementations can use the GSS_Wrap_size_limit call to
   determine the corresponding maximum size input_message.

4.  SPNEGO

   Use of the Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism
   [SPNEGO] underneath SASL introduces subtle interoperability problems
   and security considerations.  To address these, this section places
   additional requirements on implementations which support SPNEGO
   underneath SASL.

   A client which supports, for example, the Kerberos V5 GSSAPI
   mechanism only underneath SPNEGO underneath the "GSS-SPNEGO" SASL
   mechanism will not interoperate with a server which supports the
   Kerberos V5 GSSAPI mechanism only underneath the "GSSAPI" SASL
   mechanism.

   Since SASL is capable of negotiating amongst GSSAPI mechanisms, the
   only reason for a server or client to support the "GSS-SPNEGO"
   mechanism is to allow a policy of only using mechanisms below a
   certain strength if those mechanism's negotiation is protected.  In
   such a case, a client or server would only want to negotiate those
   weaker mechanisms through SPNEGO.  In any case, there is no down-
   negotiation security consideration with using the strongest mechanism
   and set of options the implementation supports, so for
   interoperability that mechanism and set of options MUST be negotiable
   without using the "GSS-SPNEGO" mechanism.

   If a client's policy is to first prefer GSSAPI mechanism X, then non-
   GSSAPI mechanism Y, then GSSAPI mechanism Z, and if a server supports
   mechanisms Y and Z but not X, then if the client attempts to
   negotiate mechanism X by using the "GSS-SPNEGO" SASL mechanism, it
   may end up using mechanism Z when it should have used mechanism Y.
   For this reason, implementations MUST exclude from SPNEGO those
   GSSAPI mechanisms which are weaker than the strongest non-GSSAPI SASL
   mechanism advertised by the server.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is directed to modify the existing registration for "GSSAPI"
   as follows:

   Family of SASL mechanisms: NO

   SASL mechanism name: GSSAPI

   Security considerations: ?

   Published Specification: RFC [THIS-DOC]

   Person & email address to contact for further information: Alexey
      Melnikov <Alexey.Melnikov@isode.com>

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Owner/Change controller: iesg@ietf.org

   Additional Information: This mechanism is for the Kerberos V5
      mechanism of GSSAPI.  Other GSSAPI mechanisms use other SASL
      mechanism names, as described in this mechanism's published
      specification.


   The IANA is directed to modify the existing registration for "GSS-
   SPNEGO" as follows:

   Family of SASL mechanisms: NO

6.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are discussed throughout this memo.

   When a server or client supports multiple authentication mechanisms,
   each of which has a different security strength, it is possible for
   an active attacker to cause a party to use the least secure mechanism
   supported.  To protect against this sort of attack, a client or
   server which supports mechanisms of different strengths should have a
   configurable minimum strength that it will use.  It is not sufficient
   for this minimum strength check to only be on the server, since an
   active attacker can change which mechanisms the client sees as being
   supported, causing the client to send authentication credentials for
   its weakest supported mechanism.

   The client's selection of a SASL mechanism is done in the clear and
   may be modified by an active attacker.  It is important for any new
   SASL mechanisms to be designed such that an active attacker cannot
   obtain an authentication with weaker security properties by modifying
   the SASL mechanism name and/or the challenges and responses.

   [SPNEGO] has protection against many of these down-negotiation
   attacks, SASL does not itself have such protection.  The section
   titled "SPNEGO" mentions considerations of choosing negotiation
   through SASL versus SPNEGO.

   The integrity protection provided by the security layer is useless to
   the client unless the client also requests mutual authentication.
   Therefore, a client wishing to benefit from the integrity protection
   of a security layer MUST pass to the GSS_Init_sec_context call a
   mutual_req_flag of TRUE.

   When constructing the input_name_string, the client should not
   canonicalize the server's fully qualified domain name using an
   insecure or untrusted directory service.

   Additional security considerations are in the [SASL] and [GSSAPI]
   specifications.  Additional security considerations for the GSSAPI
   mechanism can be found in [KRB5GSS].
