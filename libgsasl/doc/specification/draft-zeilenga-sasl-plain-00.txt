  authentication mechanism, intended to be used with confidentiality

1. Background and Intended Usage

  Clear-text passwords are simple, interoperate with almost all existing
  operating system authentication databases, and are useful for a smooth
  transition to a more secure password-based authentication mechanism.
  The drawback is that they are unacceptable for use over an unencrypted
  network connection.

  This document defines the "PLAIN" Simple Authentication and Security
  Layer ([SASL]) mechanism for use in protocols with no clear-text login
  command (e.g., ACAP).

  The PLAIN SASL mechanism MUST NOT be used without adequate security
  protection as the mechanism affords no integrity nor confidentiality
  protection itself.  The PLAIN SASL mechanism MUST NOT be advertised
  unless a strong encryption layer (such as provided by [TLS]) is
  active.

  This document updates RFC 2595, replacing Section 6.  Changes since
  RFC 2595 are detailed in Appendix A.


2. PLAIN SASL mechanism

  The mechanism consists of a single message from the client to the
  server.  The client sends the authorization identity (identity to
  login as), followed by a NUL character, followed by the authentication
  identity (identity whose password will be used), followed by a NUL
  character, followed by the clear-text password.   The client may leave
  the authorization identity empty if wishes the server to derive the
  authorization identity from the provided the authentication identity.

  The authorization identity, authentication identity, password, and the
  NUL character SHALL be transferred as [UTF-8] encoded string of
  printable [Unicode] characters in Unicode Normalisation Form KC
  [NFKC].

  The following characters are considered non-printable:
      - control characters: U+0000..U+001F, U+007F..U+009F;
      - replacement character: U+FFFD; and
      - special characters and noncharacter: U+FEFF, U+FFFE, U+FFFF.

  The server will verify the authentication identity and password with
  the system authentication database and verify that the authentication
  credentials permit the client to login as the authorization identity.
  If both steps succeed, the user is logged in.

  The server MAY also use the password to initialize any new
  authentication database, such as one suitable for [CRAM-MD5] or
  [DIGEST-MD5].

      message         = [authorize-id] NUL authenticate-id NUL password
      authenticate-id = 1*UTF8-SAFE      ; MUST accept up to 255 octets
      authorize-id    = 1*UTF8-SAFE      ; MUST accept up to 255 octets
      password        = 1*UTF8-SAFE      ; MUST accept up to 255 octets
      NUL             = %x00
      UTF8-SAFE       = %x01-09 / %x0B-0C / %x0E-7F / UTF8-2 /
                        UTF8-3 / UTF8-4 / UTF8-5 / UTF8-6
      UTF8-1          = %x80-BF
      UTF8-2          = %xC0-DF UTF8-1
      UTF8-3          = %xE0-EF 2UTF8-1
      UTF8-4          = %xF0-F7 3UTF8-1
      UTF8-5          = %xF8-FB 4UTF8-1
      UTF8-6          = %xFC-FD 5UTF8-1


4. Example

  Here is an example of how this might be used to initialize a CRAM-MD5
  authentication database for ACAP:

      S: * ACAP (SASL "CRAM-MD5") (STARTTLS)
      C: a001 AUTHENTICATE "CRAM-MD5"
      S: + "<1896.697170952@postoffice.reston.mci.net>"
      C: "tim b913a602c7eda7a495b4e6e7334d3890"
      S: a001 NO (TRANSITION-NEEDED)
         "Please change your password, or use TLS to login"
      C: a002 STARTTLS
      S: a002 OK "Begin TLS negotiation now"
      <TLS negotiation, further commands are under TLS layer>
      S: * ACAP (SASL "CRAM-MD5" "PLAIN" "EXTERNAL")
      C: a003 AUTHENTICATE "PLAIN" {21+}
      C: <NUL>tim<NUL>tanstaaftanstaaf
      S: a003 OK CRAM-MD5 password initialized

  Note: In this example, <NUL> represents a single NUL (U+0000) octet.


5. Security Considerations

  The PLAIN mechanism relies on the TLS encryption layer for security.
  When used without TLS, it is vulnerable to a common network
  eavesdropping attack.  Therefore PLAIN MUST NOT be advertised or used
  unless a suitable TLS encryption layer is active or backwards
  compatibility dictates otherwise.

  When the PLAIN mechanism is used, the server gains the ability to
  impersonate the user to all services with the same password regardless
  of any encryption provided by TLS or other network privacy mechanisms.
  While many other authentication mechanisms have similar weaknesses,
  stronger SASL mechanisms such as the Kerberos-based GSSAPI mechanism
  address this issue.  Clients are encouraged to have an operational
  mode where all mechanisms which are likely to reveal the user's
  password to the server are disabled.

  Clients are encouraged to have an operational mode where all
  mechanisms which are likely to reveal the user's password to the
  server are disabled.  It is RECOMMENDED that this mode be the default.

  The security considerations for SASL apply to the PLAIN mechanism.


6. IANA Considerations

  It is requested that the SASL Mechanism registry [IANA-SASL] entry for
  the PLAIN mechanism be updated to reflect that this document now
  provides its technical specification.
