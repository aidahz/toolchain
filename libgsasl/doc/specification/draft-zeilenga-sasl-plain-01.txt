Abstract

  This document defines a simple clear-text user/password Simple
  Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanism called the PLAIN
  mechanism.  The PLAIN mechanism intended to be used, in combination
  with data confidentiality services provided by a lower layer, in

  protocols which lack a simple password authentication command.


Conventions

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].


1. Background and Intended Usage

  Clear-text passwords are simple, interoperate with almost all existing
  operating system authentication databases, and are useful for a smooth
  transition to a more secure password-based authentication mechanism.
  The drawback is that they are unacceptable for use over an unencrypted
  network connection.

  This document defines the PLAIN Simple Authentication and Security
  Layer ([SASL]) mechanism for use in protocols with no clear-text login
  command (e.g., ACAP).

  The name associated with this mechanism is "PLAIN".

  The PLAIN SASL mechanism does not provide a security layer.  This
  mechanism MUST NOT be used without adequate security protection as the
  mechanism affords no integrity nor confidentiality protection itself.
  The PLAIN SASL mechanism MUST NOT be advertised unless a strong
  encryption layer, such as provided by Transport Layer Security
  ([TLS]), is active.

  This document updates RFC 2595, replacing Section 6.  Changes since
  RFC 2595 are detailed in Appendix A.


2. PLAIN SASL mechanism

  The mechanism consists of a single message from the client to the
  server.  The client sends the authorization identity (identity to
  login as), followed by a NUL character, followed by the authentication
  identity (identity whose password will be used), followed by a NUL
  character, followed by the clear-text password.   The client may leave
  the authorization identity empty if wishes the server to derive the
  authorization identity from the provided the authentication identity.

  The authorization identity (authzid), authentication identity
  (authcid) and password (passwd) SHALL be transferred as [UTF-8]
  encoded strings of printable [Unicode] characters in Unicode

  Normalisation Form KC [NFKC] delimitated by the NUL (U+0000)
  character.

  The following characters are considered non-printable:
      - control characters: U+0000..U+001F, U+007F..U+009F;
      - replacement character: U+FFFD; and
      - special characters and noncharacter: U+FEFF, U+FFFE, U+FFFF.

  The server will verify the authentication identity (authcid) and
  password (passwd) with the system authentication database and verify
  that the authentication credentials permit the client to login as the
  authorization identity (authzid).  If both steps succeed, the user is
  logged in.

  The server MAY also use the password to initialize any new
  authentication database, such as one suitable for [CRAM-MD5] or
  [DIGEST-MD5].

  The formal grammar for the client message using Augmented BNF [ABNF]
  follows.

      message   = [authzid] NUL authcid NUL passwd
      authcid   = 1*SAFE ; MUST accept up to 255 octets
      authzid   = 1*SAFE ; MUST accept up to 255 octets
      passwd    = 1*SAFE ; MUST accept up to 255 octets
      NUL       = %x00

      SAFE      = UTF1 / UTF2 / UTF3 / UTF4 / UTF5 / UTF6 / UTF7
                  ;; any UTF-8 encoded Unicode printable character

      UTF1   = %x01-7F
      UTF2      = %xC0-DF 1(UTF0)
      UTF3      = %xE0-EF 2(UTF0)
      UTF4      = %xF0-F7 3(UTF0)
      UTF5      = %xF8-FB 4(UTF0)
      UTF6      = %xFC-FD 5(UTF0)
      UTF0      = %x80-BF


4. Example


  Here is an example of how this might be used to initialize a CRAM-MD5
  authentication database for ACAP.  "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent
  by the client and server respectively.

      S: * ACAP (SASL "CRAM-MD5") (STARTTLS)
      C: a001 AUTHENTICATE "CRAM-MD5"

INTERNET-DRAFT      draft-zeilenga-sasl-plain-01.txt     4 November 2002


      S: + "<1896.697170952@postoffice.reston.mci.net>"
      C: "tim b913a602c7eda7a495b4e6e7334d3890"
      S: a001 NO (TRANSITION-NEEDED)
         "Please change your password, or use TLS to login"
      C: a002 STARTTLS
      S: a002 OK "Begin TLS negotiation now"
      <TLS negotiation, further commands are under TLS layer>
      S: * ACAP (SASL "CRAM-MD5" "PLAIN" "EXTERNAL")
      C: a003 AUTHENTICATE "PLAIN" {21+}
      C: <NUL>tim<NUL>tanstaaftanstaaf
      S: a003 OK CRAM-MD5 password initialized

  In this example, <NUL> represents a single NUL (U+0000) character.


5. Security Considerations

  The PLAIN mechanism relies on the TLS encryption layer for security.
  When used without TLS, it is vulnerable to a common network
  eavesdropping attack.  Therefore PLAIN MUST NOT be advertised or used
  unless a suitable TLS encryption layer is active or backwards
  compatibility dictates otherwise.

  When the PLAIN mechanism is used, the server gains the ability to
  impersonate the user to all services with the same password regardless
  of any encryption provided by TLS or other network privacy mechanisms.
  While many other authentication mechanisms have similar weaknesses,
  stronger SASL mechanisms such as the Kerberos-based GSSAPI mechanism
  address this issue.  Clients are encouraged to have an operational
  mode where all mechanisms which are likely to reveal the user's
  password to the server are disabled.

  Clients are encouraged to have an operational mode where all
  mechanisms which are likely to reveal the user's password to the
  server are disabled.  It is RECOMMENDED that this mode be the default.

  General SASL security considerations apply to this mechanism.


6. IANA Considerations

  It is requested that the SASL Mechanism registry [IANA-SASL] entry for
  the PLAIN mechanism be updated to reflect that this document now
  provides its technical specification.
