Abstract

     It is common today for Internet client software to implement
     multiple Internet protocols.  SASL [SASL] provides an
     authentication framework which permits multi-protocol clients and
     servers to reuse security-sensitive authentication code.  This memo
     defines a SASL profile for the Telnet [TELNET] protocol.

     This proposal will be discussed on the telnet-ietf mailing list.

     passive open) respectively.

2. Background for this Proposal

     Telnet has its own single-protocol authentication framework defined
     in "Telnet Authentication Option" [TELNET-AUTH] which predates SASL
     [SASL].  This old Telnet authentication option and the associated
     encryption option [TELNET-ENC] do not provide integrity protection
     facilities, machine parsible error codes (e.g. to alert the client
     of an expired passphrase), or a way to integrate GSSAPI [GSSAPI]
     into Telnet.

     Adding SASL and using it for new authentication mechanisms will
     improve reuse of security-sensitive code in multi-protocol clients
     in addition to addressing the other issues.  While it would be
     possible to layer SASL support on top of the existing
     authentication option, it could result in an extra round-trip and
     would have potentially confusing interactions with the modifiers
     field in the Telnet authentication option.

3. Kerberos Compatibility

     Both SASL and the old Telnet authentication option offer Kerberos
     V4 mechanisms.  It is usually not desirable to deploy two
     incompatible mechanisms for the same function, however, the
     KERBEROS_V4 SASL mechanism is more resistant to reply attacks and
     provides integrity services.  Currently deployed Kerberos V4 Telnet
     implementations have no integrity protection and the encryption
     service is subject to an active down negotiation attack.

     Implementations which offer support for the KERBEROS_V4 SASL
     mechanism SHOULD also implement the old Telnet authentication
     option Kerberos v4 mechanism.  This will provide better
     interoperability with deployed implementations.  When both options
     are available, the KERBEROS_V4 SASL mechanism SHOULD be used in
     preference to the old Telnet authentication mechanism, unless
     encryption without integrity protection is desired.

     Both the SASL GSSAPI mechanism and the old Telnet authentication
     option offer Kerberos V5 mechanisms.  The only difference is that
     the SASL GSSAPI Kerberos 5 mechanism includes integrity protection
     not available via the old authentication and encryption options.  A
     server supporting Kerberos V5 SHOULD implement the old Kerberos V5
     authentication option for backwards compatibility.

4. SASL Telnet Option

     The GSSAPI/SASL service name for this profile of SASL is "rcmd".

Internet Draft             Telnet SASL Option              November 1998


     The SASL Telnet option is Telnet option number XXX.  It has the
     following subnegotiation options:

          LIST       0
          START      1
          STEP       2
          CANCEL     3
          DONE       4

     The DONE subnegotiation option has the following codes:

          SUCCESS    0
          CANCELLED  1
          BADAUTH    2
          BADPROT    3
          NOTAUTHZ   4
          EXPIRED    5
          ENCRYPT    6
          TOOWEAK    7
          TRANS      8
          DISABLED   9

     The SASL Telnet option is negotiated only one way.  The server asks
     the client to use SASL with "DO SASL" and the client announces
     support with a "WILL SASL" message.  Once the option is
     successfully negotiated, the server sends the LIST subnegotiation
     containing an ASCII string with a space separated list of available
     SASL mechanisms:

     S: IAC DO SASL
     C: IAC WILL SASL
     S: IAC SB SASL LIST "KERBEROS_V4 GSSAPI CRAM-MD5 OTP" IAC SB

     The client sends the START subnegotiation to begin a SASL exchange
     with the server.  The START subnegotiation contains the desired
     mechanism name optionally followed by an ASCII NUL character and an
     initial client response.  The client is not required to wait for
     the LIST message from the server prior to sending a START message.

     C: IAC SB SASL START "CRAM-MD5" IAC SE

     This is followed by a series of STEP messages containing SASL
     messages for the client and server respectively:

     S: IAC SB SASL STEP
         "<1896.697170952@postoffice.reston.mci.net>" IAC SE
     C: IAC SB SASL STEP "tim b913a602c7eda7a495b4e6e7334d3890" IAC SE

Internet Draft             Telnet SASL Option              November 1998


     Note that it is important to perform IAC doubling if the octet
     value 255 occurs in any SASL data.  This applies to data in the
     START, STEP and DONE suboptions.

     When a client receives a STEP message from the server, it MAY
     cancel the authentication with the CANCEL message.  The server will
     respond with a DONE CANCELLED message.  If the client wishes to
     begin a new authentication, it MAY send a START message without
     waiting for the server DONE CANCELLED message.

     C: IAC SB SASL CANCEL IAC SE
     S: IAC SB SASL DONE CANCELLED IAC SE

     The server indicates successful completion of the exchange by
     sending the DONE subnegotiation with SUCCESS status, which MAY
     contain final server authentication data (usually for mutual
     authentication purposes).

     S: IAC SB SASL DONE SUCCESS IAC SE

     If a SASL security layer is negotiated, it begins on the server end
     immediately after the DONE SUCCESS subnegotiation, and begins on
     the client end immediately after the last client START or STEP
     subnegotiation once the SUCCESS subnegotiation is received.

     For those cases where a security layer including integrity
     protection is negotiated, the server SHOULD send another LIST
     suboption message matching the one initially sent.  If the client
     supports any stronger authentication mechanism, it SHOULD verify
     that the new LIST suboption matches the one sent prior to
     authentication.

     The server indicates failure by sending the DONE message with a
     code other than SUCCESS, followed by a human readable string in the
     character set currently active on the Telnet channel.  If no
     character set has been negotiated through prior agreement or the
     Telnet CHARSET option [TELNET-CHARSET], then UTF-8 [UTF-8] is
     assumed.

     S: IAC SB SASL DONE BADAUTH "Authentication Failed" IAC SE

     The following error codes are defined by this specification.  When
     in doubt of the appropriate error code, the BADAUTH error code
     should be used.  Additional error codes MAY be defined by future
     standards track or IESG approved experimental RFCs.

     CANCELLED
          The authentication was cancelled by the client.

Internet Draft             Telnet SASL Option              November 1998


     BADAUTH
          This indicates that the user does not exist or the
          authentication failed for a reason other than those listed
          below.

     BADPROT
          This indicates the client attempted to use a mechanism not
          supported by the server, or the protocol for the SASL
          mechanism was not followed.

     NOTAUTHZ
          This indicates the client successfully authenticated, but is
          not authorized to login to the service with the requested SASL
          authorization identity.

     EXPIRED
          This indicates that the client passphrase, public key
          certificate or other credential has expired and can be updated
          with an appropriate passphrase/credential change protocol.

     ENCRYPT
          This indicates that the requested client mechanism is not
          permitted without an encryption layer, such as that provided
          by TLS.  The client may activate such encryption, or try a
          stronger mechanism.

     TOOWEAK
          This indicates that security policy does not permit the
          requested user to use the requested mechanism.  For example,
          an administrative user might be required to use a stronger
          mechanism.

     TRANS
          This indicates the user has a valid verifier in a server
          authentication database but the requested mechanism can not be
          used with that verifier.  This also indicates that if the
          client changes the passphrase or does a one-time
          authentication with a clear-text passphrase mechanism
          (preferably encrypted), then the appropriate authentication
          database for the requested mechanism will be initialized.

     DISABLED
          This indicates that the user's account has been disabled.  The
          user must contact a system administrator to get their account
          re-enabled.

5. Formal Syntax

     The following formal syntax uses ABNF [ABNF]:

       IAC          = %d255    ; standard Telnet symbols
       DO           = %d253
       WILL         = %d251
       SB           = %d250

       SASL         = %dXXX    ; Telnet SASL option
       LIST         = %d0      ; Telnet SASL sub-options
       START        = %d1
       STEP         = %d2
       CANCEL       = %d3
       DONE         = %d4

       ; Miscellaneous single-character symbols
       DIGIT        = %d30-39  ; US-ASCII digit character
       UPALPHA      = %d65-90  ; Uppercase alphabetic characters
       MECH-CHAR    = %d65-90 / DIGIT / "-" / "_"
       SAFE-DATA    = %d0-254  ; octets which don't need quoting
       TEXT         = %d1-254  ; human readable text
       SP           = %d32     ; US-ASCII space
       NUL          = %d0      ; US-ASCII NUL

       ; Miscellaneous multi-character symbols
       quoted-255   = %d255 %d255
       sasl-mech    = 1*20mech-char
       subopt-data  = SAFE-DATA / quoted-255
       text         = *subopt-data  ; human readable text
       sasl-data    = *subopt-data
       success      = %d0 sasl-data
       error        = %d1-254 text

       ; Telnet SASL messages
       sasl-do      = IAC DO SASL
       sasl-will    = IAC WILL SASL
       sasl-list    = IAC SB SASL LIST *(sasl-mech SP) sasl-mech IAC SE
       sasl-start   = IAC SB SASL START sasl-mech [NUL sasl-data] IAC SE
       sasl-step    = IAC SB SASL STEP sasl-data IAC SE
       sasl-cancel  = IAC SB SASL CANCEL IAC SE
       sasl-done    = IAC SB SASL DONE (success / error) IAC SE

6. Security Considerations

     This inherits the security considerations of SASL [SASL] and any
     underlying mechanism used.




Newman                                                          [Page 6]

Internet Draft             Telnet SASL Option              November 1998


     The SASL LIST subnegotiation is not integrity protected and is thus
     susceptible to tampering by an active attacker.  There are two ways
     to mitigate this attack: (1) have the client explicitly configured
     to use a specific mechanism and never fall back to a weaker one.
     (2) have the client configurable to require integrity protection,
     and verify that the LIST suboption value is the same both before
     and after the integrity protection is applied.

     With some SASL mechanisms, the ENCRYPT or TOOWEAK error codes will
     be generated after sensitive information has been exposed.  For
     this reason, clients SHOULD be configurable to disable weaker
     mechanisms which might reveal sensitive information and SHOULD do
     so for user, mechanism and server combinations which result in
     these error codes.

     The TRANS error code could be spuriously generated by an active
     attacker.  For this reason, the client SHOULD NOT use a weaker
     mechanism in response to a TRANS error code without explicit user
     permission.  The TRANS error code can also be used to probe for
     untransitioned users at a site.  For this reason, sites must
     consider the tradeoffs between a user-friendly transition to a
     stronger mechanism and the risks entailed by permitting such
     transitions.

     Telnet server and client implementations MUST check for buffer
     overrun on Telnet subnegotiations and deal with more data than will
     fit in an internal buffer gracefully.
