Abstract

    To date, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) has used a
    Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) profile which always
    required at least one complete round trip for an authentication, as
    it did not support an initial client response argument.  This
    additional round trip at the beginning of the session is
    undesirable, especially when round trip costs are high.

    This document defines an extension to IMAP which allows clients and
    servers to avoid this round trip by allowing an initial client
    response argument to the IMAP AUTHENTICATE command.

IMAP Extension for SASL Initial Client Response		  November, 2003


    Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS]

    In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
    server respectively.

    Formal syntax is defined using [ABNF] as modified by [IMAP4].

2.  Introduction

    The [SASL] initial client response extension is present in any
    [IMAP4] server implementation which returns "SASL-IR" as one of the
    supported capabilities in its CAPABILITY response.

    Servers which support this extension will accept an optional initial
    client response with the AUTHENTICATE command for any [SASL]
    mechanisms which support it.  Clients which support this extension
    SHOULD make use of the initial response whenever they attempt to
    authenticate using a SASL mechanism which supports it.

3.  IMAP Changes to the IMAP AUTHENTICATE Command

    This extension adds an optional second argument to the AUTHENTICATE
    command that is defined in Section 6.2.2 of [IMAP4].  If this second
    argument is present, it represents the contents of the "initial
    client response" defined in section 5.1 of [SASL].

    As with any other client response, this initial client response MUST
    be [BASE64] encoded.  It also MUST be transmitted outside of a
    quoted string or literal.  To send a zero-length initial response,
    the client MUST send a single pad character ("=").	This indicates
    that the response is present, but is a zero-length string.

    When decoding the [BASE64] data in the initial client response,
    decoding errors MUST be treated as [IMAP4] would handle them in any
    normal SASL client response.  In particular, the server should check
    for any characters not explicitly allowed by the BASE64 alphabet, as
    well as any sequence of BASE64 characters that contains the pad
    character ('=') anywhere other than the end of the string (e.g.
    "=AAA" and "AAA=BBB" are not allowed).

    Note: support and use of the initial client response is optional for
    both clients and servers.  Servers which implement this extension
    MUST support clients which omit the initial client response, and
    clients which implement this extension MUST NOT send an initial
    client response to servers which do not advertise the SASL-IR
    capability.	 In such a situation, clients MUST fall back to an
    [IMAP4] compatible mode.

IMAP Extension for SASL Initial Client Response		  November, 2003


    If either the client or the server do not support the SASL-IR
    capability, a mechanism which uses an initial client response is
    negotiated using the challenge/response exchange described in
    [IMAP4], with an initial zero-length server challenge.


4.  Examples

    The following is an example authentication using the [PLAIN] SASL
    mechanism (under a [TLS] protection layer) and an initial client
    response:

      ... client connects to server and negotiates a TLS protection layer ...
     C: C01 CAPABILITY
     S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN
     S: C01 OK Completed
     C: A01 AUTHENTICATE PLAIN dGVzdAB0ZXN0AHRlc3Q=
     S: A01 OK Success (tls protection)

    Note that even when a server supports this extension, the following
    negotiation (which does not use the initial response) is still valid
    and MUST be supported by the server:

      ... client connects to server and negotiates a TLS protection layer ...
     C: C01 CAPABILITY
     S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN
     S: C01 OK Completed
     C: A01 AUTHENTICATE PLAIN
      (note that there is a space following the "+" in the following line)
     S: +
     C: dGVzdAB0ZXN0AHRlc3Q=
     S: A01 OK Success (tls protection)

    The following is an example authentication using the EXTERNAL [SASL]
    mechanism (under a [TLS] protection layer) and an empty initial
    client response:

      ... client connects to server and negotiates a TLS protection layer ...
     C: C01 CAPABILITY
     S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=EXTERNAL
     S: C01 OK Completed
     C: A01 AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL =
     S: A01 OK Success (tls protection)








Siemborski		   Expires April, 2004		        [Page 4]





IMAP Extension for SASL Initial Client Response		  November, 2003


    This is in contrast with the handling of such a situation when an
    initial response is omitted:

      ... client connects to server and negotiates a TLS protection layer ...
     C: C01 CAPABILITY
     S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=EXTERNAL
     S: C01 OK Completed
     C: A01 AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL
      (note that there is a space following the "+" in the following line)
     S: +
     C:
     S: A01 OK Success (tls protection)


5.  Formal Syntax

    The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Bakus-Naur
    Form [ABNF] notation.  Non-terminals referenced but not defined
    below are as defined by [IMAP4].

     capability	   =/ "SASL-IR"

     authenticate  = "AUTHENTICATE" SP auth-type [SP (base64 / "=")]
		     *(CRLF base64)
		       ;;redefine AUTHENTICATE command defined in [IMAP4]


6.  Security Considerations

    The extension defined in this document is subject to many of the
    Security Considerations defined in [IMAP4] and [SASL].

    Server implementations MUST treat the omission of an initial client
    response from the AUTHENTICATE command as defined by [IMAP4] (as if
    this extension did not exist).

    Although [IMAP4] has no express line length limitations, some
    implementations choose to enforce them anyway.  Such implementations
    MUST be aware that the addition of the initial response parameter to
    AUTHENTICATE may increase the maximum line length that IMAP parsers
    may expect to support.  Server implementations MUST be able to
    receive the largest possible initial client response that their
    supported mechanisms might receive.

    intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
