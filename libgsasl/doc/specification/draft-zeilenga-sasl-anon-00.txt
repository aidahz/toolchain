Abstract

  It is common practice on the Internet to permit anonymous access to
  various services.  Traditionally, this has been done with a plain text
  password mechanism using "anonymous" as the user name and optional
  trace information, such as an email address, as the password.  As

  plaintext login commands are not permitted in new IETF protocols, a
  new way to provide anonymous login is needed within the context of the
  Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.


1. Anonymous SASL mechanism

  This document defines an anonymous mechanism for the Simple
  Authentication and Security Layer ([SASL]) framework.  This document
  replaces RFC 2245.  Changes since RFC 2245 are detailed in Appendix A.

  The mechanism name associated with anonymous access is "ANONYMOUS".

  The mechanism consists of a single message from the client to the
  server.  The client sends optional trace information in the form of a
  human readable string of UTF-8 [UTF8] encoded characters from the
  Universal Character Set ([UCS]) characters.  The trace information
  should take one of three forms:  an Internet email address, an opaque
  string which does not contain the '@' (U+0040) character and can be
  interpreted by the system administrator of the client's domain, or
  nothing.  For privacy reasons, an Internet email address should only
  be used with permission from the user.

  A server which permits anonymous access will announce support for the
  ANONYMOUS mechanism, and allow anyone to log in using that mechanism,
  usually with restricted access.

  The formal grammar for the client message using Augmented BNF [ABNF]
  follows.

      message     = [email / token]

      UTF1        = %x00-3F / %x41-7F ;; less '@' (U+0040)
      UTF2        = %xC0-DF 1(UTF0)
      UTF3        = %xE0-EF 2(UTF0)
      UTF4        = %xF0-F7 3(UTF0)
      UTF5        = %xF8-FB 4(UTF0)
      UTF6        = %xFC-FD 5(UTF0)
      UTF0        = %x80-BF

      TCHAR       = UTF1 / UTF2 / UTF3 / UTF3 / UTF4 / UTF5 / UTF6
                    ;; any printable UTF-8 encoded UCS character
                    ;; except '@' (U+0040)

      email       = addr-spec
                    ;; as defined in [IMAIL], except with no free
                    ;; insertion of linear-white-space, and the
                    ;; local-part MUST either be entirely enclosed in

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-sasl-anon-00.txt        23 June 2002


                    ;; quotes or entirely unquoted

      token       = 1*255TCHAR

  The following characters are considered non-printable:
      - control characters: U+0000..U+001F, U+007F..U+009F;
      - replacement character: U+FFFD; and
      - special characters and noncharacter: U+FEFF, U+FFFE, U+FFFF.


2. Example

  Here is a sample ANONYMOUS login between an IMAP client and server.
  In this example, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
  server respectively.  If such lines are wrapped without a new "C:" or
  "S:" label, then the wrapping is for editorial clarity and is not part
  of the command.

  Note that this example uses the IMAP profile [IMAP4] of SASL.  The
  base64 encoding of challenges and responses, as well as the "+ "
  preceding the responses are part of the IMAP4 profile, not part of
  SASL itself.  Newer profiles of SASL will include the client message
  with the AUTHENTICATE command itself so the extra round trip below
  (the server response with an empty "+ ") can be eliminated.

  In this example, the user's opaque identification token is "sirhc".

      S: * OK IMAP4 server ready
      C: A001 CAPABILITY
      S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 AUTH=CRAM-MD5 AUTH=ANONYMOUS
      S: A001 OK done
      C: A002 AUTHENTICATE ANONYMOUS
      S: +
      C: c2lyaGM=
      S: A003 OK Welcome, trace information has been logged.


3. Security Considerations

  The ANONYMOUS mechanism grants access to information by anyone.  For
  this reason it should be disabled by default so the administrator can
  make an explicit decision to enable it.

  If the anonymous user has any write privileges, a denial of service
  attack is possible by filling up all available space.  This can be
  prevented by disabling all write access by anonymous users.

  If anonymous users have read and write access to the same area, the

  server can be used as a communication mechanism to anonymously
  exchange information.  Servers which accept anonymous submissions
  should implement the common "drop box" model which forbids anonymous
  read access to the area where anonymous submissions are accepted.

  If the anonymous user can run many expensive operations (e.g., an IMAP
  SEARCH BODY command), this could enable a denial of service attack.
  Servers are encouraged to limit the number of anonymous users and
  reduce their priority or limit their resource usage.

  If there is no idle timeout for the anonymous user and there is a
  limit on the number of anonymous users, a denial of service attack is
  enabled.  Servers should implement an idle timeout for anonymous
  users.

  The trace information is not authenticated so it can be falsified.
  This can be used as an attempt to get someone else in trouble for
  access to questionable information.  Administrators trying to trace
  abuse need to realize this information may be falsified.

  A client which uses the user's correct email address as trace
  information without explicit permission may violate that user's
  privacy.  Information about who accesses an anonymous archive on a
  sensitive subject (e.g., sexual abuse) has strong privacy needs.
  Clients should not send the email address without explicit permission
  of the user and should offer the option of supplying no trace token --
  thus only exposing the source IP address and time.  Anonymous proxy
  servers could enhance this privacy, but would have to consider the
  resulting potential denial of service attacks.

  Anonymous connections are susceptible to man in the middle attacks
  which view or alter the data transferred.  Clients and servers are
  encouraged to support external integrity and encryption mechanisms.

  Protocols which fail to require an explicit anonymous login are more
  susceptible to break-ins given certain common implementation
  techniques.  Specifically, Unix servers which offer user login may
  initially start up as root and switch to the appropriate user id after
  an explicit login command.  Normally such servers refuse all data
  access commands prior to explicit login and may enter a restricted
  security environment (e.g., the Unix chroot(2) function) for anonymous
  users.  If anonymous access is not explicitly requested, the entire
  data access machinery is exposed to external security attacks without
  the chance for explicit protective measures.  Protocols which offer
  restricted data access should not allow anonymous data access without
  an explicit login step.

  the ANONYMOUS mechanism be updated to reflect that this document now
  provides its technical specification.

Appendix A.  Changes since RFC 2245

  RFC 2245 allows the client to send optional trace information in the
  form of a human readable string, but did not define the character
  encoding nor character set to be used.  This document mandates use of
  UTF-8 encoded UCS characters.  The grammar was updated to reflect
  this.

  Additionally, a number of editorial changes were made.
