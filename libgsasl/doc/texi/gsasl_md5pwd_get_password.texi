@deftypefun {int} {gsasl_md5pwd_get_password} (const char * @var{filename}, const char * @var{username}, char * @var{key}, size_t * @var{keylen})
@var{filename}: filename of file containing passwords.

@var{username}: username string.

@var{key}: output character array.

@var{keylen}: input maximum size of output character array, on output
contains actual length of output array.

Retrieve password for user from specified file.  To find out how
large the output array must be, call this function with out=NULL.

The file should be on the UoW "MD5 Based Authentication" format,
which means it is in text format with comments denoted by # first
on the line, with user entries looking as "usernameTABpassword".
This function removes CR and LF at the end of lines before
processing.  TAB, CR, and LF denote ASCII values 9, 13, and 10,
respectively.

@strong{Return value:} Return GSASL_OK if output buffer contains the
password, GSASL_AUTHENTICATION_ERROR if the user could not be
found, or other error code.

@strong{Deprecated:} Use @code{gsasl_simple_getpass()} instead.
