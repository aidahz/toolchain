@deftypefun {void} {gsasl_callback_hook_set} (Gsasl * @var{ctx}, void * @var{hook})
@var{ctx}: libgsasl handle.

@var{hook}: opaque pointer to application specific data.

Store application specific data in the libgsasl handle.

The application data can be later (for instance, inside a callback)
be retrieved by calling @code{gsasl_callback_hook_get()}.  This is
normally used by the application to maintain a global state between
the main program and callbacks.
