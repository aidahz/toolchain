@deftypefun {void} {gsasl_callback_set} (Gsasl * @var{ctx}, Gsasl_callback_function @var{cb})
@var{ctx}: handle received from @code{gsasl_init()}.

@var{cb}: pointer to function implemented by application.

Store the pointer to the application provided callback in the
library handle.  The callback will be used, via @code{gsasl_callback()},
by mechanisms to discover various parameters (such as username and
passwords).  The callback function will be called with a
Gsasl_property value indicating the requested behaviour.  For
example, for @code{GSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN}, the function is expected to
invoke gsasl_property_set(@code{CTX}, @code{GSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN}, "token")
where "token" is the anonymous token the application wishes the
SASL mechanism to use.  See the manual for the meaning of all
parameters.
