@deftypefn Prototype int (*Gsasl_client_callback_authorization_id) (Gsasl_session_ctx * @var{ctx}, char * @var{out}, size_t * @var{outlen})

@var{ctx}:  libgsasl handle.

@var{out}:  output array with authorization identity.

@var{outlen}:  on input the maximum size of the output array, on output
contains the actual size of the output array.

Type of callback function the application implements.  It should
populate the output array with authorization identity of user and set
the output array length, and return @code{GSASL_OK}, or fail with an
error code. The authorization identity must be encoded in UTF-8, but
need not be normalized in any way.

If OUT is NULL, the function should only populate the output length
field with the length, and return GSASL_OK.  This usage may be used by
the caller to allocate the proper buffer size.
