@deftypefn Prototype int (*Gsasl_server_callback_retrieve) (Gsasl_session_ctx * @var{ctx}, char * @var{authentication_id}, char * @var{authorization_id}, char * @var{realm}, char * @var{key}, size_t * @var{keylen})

@var{ctx}:  libgsasl handle.

@var{authentication_id}:  input array with authentication identity.

@var{authorization_id}:  input array with authorization identity, or NULL.

@var{realm}:  input array with realm of user, or NULL.

@var{key}:  output array with key for authentication identity.

@var{keylen}: on input the maximum size of the key output array, on
output contains the actual size of the key output array.

Type of callback function the application implements.  It should
retrieve the password for the indicated user and return GSASL_OK, or
an error code such as GSASL_AUTHENTICATION_ERROR.  The key must be
encoded in UTF-8, but need not be normalized in any way.

If KEY is NULL, the function should only populate the KEYLEN output
length field with the length, and return GSASL_OK.  This usage may be
used by the caller to allocate the proper buffer size.
