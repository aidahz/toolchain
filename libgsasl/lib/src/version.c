/**
 * gsasl_check_version:
 * @req_version: version string to compare with, or NULL.
 *
 * Check GNU SASL Library version.
 *
 * See %GSASL_VERSION for a suitable @req_version string.
 *
 * This function is one of few in the library that can be used without
 * a successful call to gsasl_init().
 *
 * Return value: Check that the version of the library is at
 *   minimum the one given as a string in @req_version and return the
 *   actual version string of the library; return NULL if the
 *   condition is not met.  If NULL is passed to this function no
 *   check is done and only the version string is returned.
