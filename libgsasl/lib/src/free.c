/**
 * gsasl_free:
 * @ptr: memory pointer
 *
 * Invoke free(@ptr) to de-allocate memory pointer.  Typically used on
 * strings allocated by other libgsasl functions.
 *
 * This is useful on Windows where libgsasl is linked to one CRT and
 * the application is linked to another CRT.  Then malloc/free will
 * not use the same heap.  This happens if you build libgsasl using
 * mingw32 and the application with Visual Studio.
 *
 * Since: 0.2.19
